-------------------// Definitions //-------------------------------

1. Subset - Any selection of elements (including empty set) from the original set, in any order.
2. Subsequence - Elements from the original sequence in the same order, but not necessarily contiguous.
3. Subarray - A subarray is a contiguous part of an array, subarrays must maintain both order and continuity of elements.



-------------------// Patterns //-------------------------------

1. Subset
Always use "Include" and "Exclude" algo to solve Subset.
--> refer Recursion/09_Subset

2. Subsequence
Always use "Include" and "Exclude" algo to solve Subsequence.
--> refer Recursion/10_SubsequenceOfString

3. Permutation
Swap the index with all the next indexes
--> refer Recursion/13_Permutations
